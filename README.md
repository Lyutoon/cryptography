# cryptography implements
My own implementions and some re-modified code from some other authors.

You can just read these easy codes to get a quick start to cryptography

Also this is a repo which is used to store some homework codes in CS152, so you can just read them if you have some problems when doing homework :)

+ CS152 implements:
  + Pollard_Rho (factorize & DLP)
  + Pohig_Hellman
  + Pollard p-1
  + Shank's Algorithm (BSGS)
  + Elgamal & It's signature
  + AES KeyExpansion
  + Miller Rabin Test
  + Wiener attack
  + jacobi (modified from libnum)
  + paiilier cryptosystem
  + Single server covering code
  + Covering code PIR 2 servers
  + Covering code PIR 4 servers
+ Other implements which are useful in CTF
  + Gaussian Reduction
  + HNP solver (SVP & CVP methods)
  + SquareRoots solver (Find all roots)
  + agcd solver (MP & SDA methods)
  + extending_wiener attack over RSA with 2 & 3 es
  + backpack cryptosystem solver
  + Simple version of Bloomer May attack over RSA
  + lcg attacker with 3 conditions
  + related-message attack over RSA (with half-gcd modified from rkm's implements and groebner basis)
